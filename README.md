# mta_tweets

I collaborated with a fellow prospective junior data scientist to explore tweets from MTA's official Twitter account for 2017 and 2018 up to July, scraped from Twitter's API. The main notebook is mta.ipynb and a blog post on the project can be found [here](https://confoley.github.io/mta_blog/).
